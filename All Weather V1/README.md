#All Weather V1 Optimisation

#####Marcus Williamson - 16/09/15

> We aim to show here that very basic quantitatively driven strategies that generate returns from different market behaviours when combined can provide a more desirable and relaiable return stream that can be leveraged to generate a superior return to the market, although we must be clear that this is not the objective.
> Below we compare the different strategies alone vs when combined in any particular combination is somewhat inferior to the quality of returns stream generated when all are combined together.
